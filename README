Hacking the University is a fork of http://usesthis.com. 

Hacking the University is a website of short interviews asking developers working in universities about their craft. It's a simple static little thing, that uses Jekyll and Github.

Interested in cloning the site for your own interviews, similar or otherwise? DO IT! These are the questions I email people:

    1) Who are you, and what do you do? (Try to keep this brief!)
    2) Who taught you how to do what you do?
    3) What tools do you use?
    4) Describe your ideal working environment.

If you *do* make your own version, send the original website (usesthis.com) author an email to the fourth letter of the alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of usesthis.com
